So for the final experiment i took a dataset from fruits 360 something from kaggle 

What this experiment does is it has two different dataset for machine learning and the dataset consist of training and test 

So why machine learning is such a interesting subject is that it learns from data and from itself to create weights to determine whether the object is the object so how does this relate to real life?

In life we have weights as well for example when i see an orange what makes it the orange , is it the color , the shape the size etc. so these are the weights we use in real life and we determine it by experience , a machine can also do that just that it takes a little more effort to do which is why machine learning can be used to apply to many scenerio to help us create robotics to help us fulfil some needs.

At the end of the day why i learn machine learning is to create robotics which can identify thorugh OCR what things are so that it can assist us in doing things
